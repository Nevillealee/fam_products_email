## Usage

## API Docs

API docs are created / maintained using YARD. Here are a couple very helpful
commands when developing againste this project.

Run a web server with all API docs (regenerates docs on file changes):
```shell
yard server -r
```

Documentation for project Gems

```shell
# after bundle install
yard gems

# to generate documentation when new gems are installed
yard config --gem-install-yri

# run server
yard server --gemfile
```
